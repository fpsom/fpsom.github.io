  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Beyond the research aspects of my work, significant time and effort is dedicated to education activities. Throughout my time as a Ph.D. student, I worked also as a Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate course “Data Structures” at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH). This allowed me to understand the particular needs of an undergraduate course as well as familiarize myself with pedagogical concepts and best practices. At the same time, I was co-supervising Diploma thesis students, therefore providing direct guidance for individual students.</p>

<p>After receiving my Ph.D. I continued my teaching activities on multiple levels; as an Academic Fellow, I provided undergraduate and graduate courses on subjects such as “Data Structures” and “Grid computing and applications in biomedicine” at AUTH. In this capacity I was responsible for preparing the training material, delivering the course as well as examining the students. As an Adjunct Lecturer at the University of West Macedonia, I taught “Advanced Topics in Software Engineering” with full responsibilities on the course, i.e. topics taught, course delivery, students’ assignments and examinations. Finally, as a Visiting Professor at Quest University Canada, I am charged with delivering a high intensity one-block course with daily classes on “Computer Programming” with Java.</p>

<p>Moreover, and beside the traditional academic activities, I have been involved with training activities for several international events as well as being a fully certified Instructor and Trainer for Software and Data Carpentry. Finally, since January 2018, I am the <a href="http://elixir.imis.athena-innovation.gr/node/209">deputy Training Coordinator for ELIXIR-GR</a>.</p>
